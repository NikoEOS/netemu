# netemu

This repository contains a set of scripts and utilities to turn a Raspberry
PI Model 3 into a network emulation device. By connecting your phone or
tablet to the emulated network provided by the Raspberry, you'll be able to
test your apps in some preset network conditions (such as 2G speeds).

To install, follow the instructions in the [documentation][docs].

Alternatively you may try running the installation script
[available here][install-script].
